# Awkward Tipping Simulator

Welcome to Awkward (Not) Tipping Simulator's GitHub repository! This is a unique and humorous escape game developed by Team "Cache Invalidation." In this game, you'll find yourself in the precarious situation of having enjoyed a meal but lacking the cash for a tip. Your mission? To exit the restaurant without getting caught in the dreaded "awkward eye contact of doom" by the waiter.

## Gameplay

- Stealth Mechanic: Sneak your way out without raising suspicion. Speedy exits might be noticed, but moving too slow may leave you vulnerable.

- Awareness Meter: Keep an eye on the waiter's current level of suspicion. Stay out of their line of sight and avoid making noise to keep this meter low.

- Distraction Items: Occasionally, you can use items (like knocking over a salt shaker) to divert the waiterâ€™s attention momentarily.

## How to Play

- Use the keyboard arrow keys for movement.
- Use the spacebar or mouse click for interactions.

## Graphics and Sound

The game features a 2D top-down perspective with a humorous and slightly cartoonish art style. The sound design includes ambient restaurant background noise, suspenseful music, and various item interaction effects to immerse you in the experience.

## Installation and Play

Platform: PC (Unity 2D engine). WebGL build for easy access on the web.

## License

This game is available under the MIT License. Feel free to use, modify, and share it as you like.

Enjoy your escape adventure and may you exit the restaurant without leaving an awkward tip!
